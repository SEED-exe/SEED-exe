# 👾 SEED — Creator of Kode Game Studio

Hey there! I'm **SEED**, an independent **game developer**, **designer**, and **founder of Kode Game Studio** — a small but ambitious team focused on building expressive, systems-driven games.

I love crafting tools, experimenting with mechanics, and pushing the limits of what a single creator can achieve with **Godot Engine**.

## 🧠 About Me
- 🎮 **Game Developer & Technical Designer** — passionate about strategy, survival, and world simulation games.  
- ⚙️ **Creator of GameForge-Kit**, a modular toolkit for Godot focused on reusability and clean architecture.  
- 🔥 Currently developing **NightSpire: Chronicles of the Ember of Orbas**, a dark-fantasy defense/strategy experience set in the world of *Calardia*.  
- 💡 I believe great gameplay emerges from meaningful constraints, not from scale.

## ⚡ Philosophy
> *“Complex worlds from simple rules.”*

I don’t aim to make massive games — I aim to make **meaningful** ones.  
Each project is an exploration of systems, balance, and emotion through interactivity.
